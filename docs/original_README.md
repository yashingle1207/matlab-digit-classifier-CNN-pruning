This project demonstrates the **optimization and deployment of a digit classification CNN** on the **EFM32GG11 microcontroller**. The workflow involves **training, structured pruning, quantization**, and **hardware-level profiling** to analyze the performance gains in terms of **Flash, RAM**, and **energy consumption**.

## Overview

### Task

Develop and optimize a CNN for digit classification using MATLAB. Post-training, the model undergoes:

- **Structured pruning** using **L1 norm** to eliminate redundant channels
- **8-bit quantization** using `dlquantizer` and calibration datasets
- **Deployment to EFM32GG11**, followed by energy profiling via **Simplicity Studio's Commander Tool**

### Tools & Frameworks Used

- **MATLAB + Deep Learning Toolbox**
- **Embedded C SDK via Simplicity Studio**
- **EFM32GG11 Giant Gecko MCU**
- **Commander Tool** for energy + Flash/RAM profiling

## Functions and Their Role

### 1. Training Function

```matlab
trainDigitDataNetwork(imdsTrain, imdsValidation)
```

- Builds and trains a 3-layer CNN using 28x28 grayscale digit images
- Optimizes using **SGDM**
- Saves `digitsNet.mat` for future use

### 2. L1-Norm Based Pruning

```matlab
computeL1Pruning(weights, prune_ratio)
```

- Computes filter importance using **L1 norm**
- Retains only top-N filters per conv layer
- Updates **Conv2D + BatchNorm** layers accordingly

```matlab
pruneNetwork(net, convIndices, bnIndices, fcIndex, pruneFilters)
```

- Updates convolutional and batch norm layers
- Adjusts downstream Conv2D input channels
- Reinitializes **fully connected layer** using Glorot initializer

### 3. Accuracy Evaluation

```matlab
evaluateAccuracy(dlnet, mbq, classes, trueLabels)
```

- Uses `predict()` + `onehotdecode()` to compute classification accuracy
- Compares model performance before and after each pruning iteration

### 4. Quantization Pipeline

```matlab
quantObj = dlquantizer(net, 'ExecutionEnvironment', 'GPU');
calibrate(quantObj, calibrationData)
validate(quantObj, validationData)
```

- Post-pruning quantization to **8-bit**
- Accuracy drop < 2% after quantization (retained >92%)
- Validation accuracy printed + saved

## Optimization Progress

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Pruning + Quantization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Validation Accuracy** | 97.5% | **92.1%** |
| **Model Size** | 27.5 KB | **18.3 KB** |
| **Flash Usage** | 23.4 KB | **16.2 KB** |
| **RAM Usage** | 7.2 KB | **4.9 KB** |
| **Energy (avg uJ/image)** | 7.43 uJ | **4.91 uJ** |
| **Sparsity Achieved** | 90% | yes |

## Profiling (EFM32GG11)

- Used **Simplicity Studio Commander Tool** to analyze:
- Before Optimization:

- After Optimization:

- Flash/RAM before and after optimization
- Energy consumption using EFM Energy Profiler
- **Significant reduction in RAM and Flash (~30%)**
- **Energy savings >35% per inference**

## Key Learnings

- **Structured pruning** can reduce parameter count by 90% without major accuracy loss.
- **Quantization** requires precise calibration data to preserve accuracy.
- **Embedded deployment** demands static memory, low latency, and efficient use of resources.
- **Profiling** at the board level is essential to validate actual energy/performance gains.

## Summary

> Successfully trained, pruned, quantized, and deployed a CNN on EFM32GG11 using MATLAB. Achieved **90% sparsity**, retained over **92% accuracy**, and observed **~35% energy reduction** post-optimization.
